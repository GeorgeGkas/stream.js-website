Streams aren't in fact a new idea at all. Many functional languages support them. The name 'stream' is used in Scheme, a LISP dialect that supports these features. Haskell also supports infinite lists. The names 'take', 'tail', 'head', 'map' and 'filter' are all used in Haskell. A different but similar concept also exists in Python and in many other languages; these are called "generators".

These ideas have been around for a long time in the functional programming community. However, they're quite new concepts for most Javascript programmers, especially those without a functional programming background.

Many of the examples and ideas come from the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html). If you like the ideas here, I highly recommend reading it; it's available online for free. It was my inspiration for building this library.

If you prefer a different syntax for streams, you can try out [linq.js](http://neue.cc/reference.htm) or, if you use node.js, [node-lazy](https://github.com/pkrumins/node-lazy) may be for you.
